# Public design adoption

Approved scope: apply the collection identity to the existing public frontend. Preserve data and functional boundaries. Changed entrypoints, vendored CSS/fonts and source documentation are listed in the Git diff.

Success criteria: one collection header, six working navigation links, readable navy palette, usable desktop/mobile menu, original analytical controls retained.

Validation: python -m pytest tests/wti/test_frontend_design_contract.py -q — 7 passed

Risk: product-specific fixed panels and offline caches need to account for the shared header. Adaptations are contained in the shared CSS and the existing PrepTürk cache.
